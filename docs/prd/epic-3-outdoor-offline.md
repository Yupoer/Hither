## Technical Considerations
- Implement offline-first architecture for map data storage
- Integrate with topographic map services (USGS, OpenStreetMap)
- Extend geo-fencing capabilities beyond basic location services
- Implement background location tracking with battery optimization
- Add satellite communication APIs for emergency services

## Dependencies
- Location services (already implemented)
- Map system - will need offline capability extension
- Push notification system (already implemented)  
- Firebase for analytics data sync when online
- Battery optimization features (already implemented)
