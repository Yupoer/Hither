# 2. User Personas & Scenarios

## 2.1. User Personas

*   **Leo the Leader:**
    *   **Background:** 45-year-old experienced hiking club leader who leads groups of 10-20 people on suburban hikes every month.
    *   **Pain Points:** Team members have varying physical abilities, causing the group to spread out. It's difficult to confirm the safety of members at the rear. Waiting and taking roll call at trail forks is time-consuming. Walkie-talkie communication can be disrupted by terrain.
    *   **Goals:** Wants a tool to see all members' locations at a glance and to send simple commands like "Rest for 5 minutes" or "Take the right fork ahead" with one tap to ensure everyone's safety.

*   **Fiona the Follower:**
    *   **Background:** 28-year-old who enjoys traveling abroad independently with friends and family. She has a poor sense of direction and easily gets separated in crowded attractions or shopping malls.
    *   **Pain Points:** Frequently needs to call or text "Where are you?". Sometimes she wants to use the restroom or browse a shop a little longer but is hesitant to speak up, fearing she'll delay the group.
    *   **Goals:** Hopes to clearly know her relative direction and distance from the leader to feel secure. Also wants a non-disruptive way to request things like "I want to find a restroom" or "I'd like to stay here for 10 more minutes."

## 2.2. User Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Hiking Activity**
    *   **Before Departure:** Leo the Leader creates a Hither group named "Yangmingshan Grand Traverse" and shares the invitation link in their LINE group. Members join by clicking the link.
    *   **On the Move:** Leo, leading from the front, occasionally opens Hither's map view to confirm all member icons are on the route. He notices two members have fallen behind by over 500 meters and uses the "Broadcast Command" to send a message: "Everyone rest for 5 minutes, wait for members at the back."
    *   **Directional Guidance:** A member who temporarily steps off the trail to take photos opens Hither's "Directional Awareness" mode. An arrow clearly points towards Leo, allowing them to rejoin the group quickly.
    *   **Unexpected Situation:** It starts raining heavily. Leo decides to cancel the rest of the trip and head to the nearest bus stop. He uses the "Itinerary Adjustment" feature to change the destination to the bus stop. All members' apps receive a push notification about the route change and an updated map.

*   **Scenario 2: Family Trip in Japan**
    *   **At Universal Studios:** The father acts as the leader, while the mother and Fiona are followers. They agree to split up and enjoy their preferred rides.
    *   **Finding Each Other:** After a ride, Fiona wants to find her parents. She opens Hither and activates the UWB-supported "Precision Finding" feature. The interface displays "Dad is 15 meters to your front-right," helping her locate her family quickly.
    *   **Making a Request:** Fiona passes a souvenir shop she wants to visit. She sends a "Request to Add Stop" to her dad via the app, with the message "I want to browse this shop for 15 minutes."
    *   **Leader's Decision:** Her dad receives the request notification, sees Fiona's location and her message. He assesses the schedule and taps "Approve." Both mother and Fiona receive a "Request Approved" notification.
    *   **Live Information:** On her iPhone's Lock Screen, Fiona can see her distance from her dad at any time via "Live Activities (ActivityKit)," without constantly unlocking her phone.
