# 1. Introduction & Vision

## 1.1. Product Name
Hither

## 1.2. Problem Statement
During group travel, outdoor activities, or family outings, it is difficult for a leader to know the exact real-time location of all members, leading to the risk of individuals getting lost or falling behind. Traditional communication methods (like phone calls or instant messaging apps) are inefficient for conveying instructions such as gathering, taking a break, or changing plans, often causing information delays or omissions. Furthermore, when the itinerary needs to be changed unexpectedly, the lack of an effective tool to quickly synchronize information with all members compromises the overall experience and safety of the activity.

## 1.3. Vision
Hither aims to be the premier tool for group movement management. Through precise real-time positioning, clear and intuitive directional guidance, and powerful team communication and itinerary coordination features, we want to make every group outing safer, smoother, and more enjoyable. Whether for professional tour leaders, family trip organizers, or outdoor activity conveners, Hither will enable them to lead their teams with ease and enjoy a worry-free journey.
